### `GitLab`CI workflow
based upon [this article](https://medium.com/@naman.mittal/automate-ios-deployment-process-by-ci-cd-using-gitlab-ci-and-fastlane-547d824ee41a)

1) You make changes to your copy of the codebase and push a commit to `GitLab`.
2) `GitLab` recognizes that the codebase has changed.
3) `GitLab` triggers a build with the `GitLab` Runner you set up on your Mac for the project.
4) The `GitLab` Runner runs through the build and test process you specified in .gitlab-ci.yml.
5) The `GitLab` Runner reports its results back to `GitLab`.
6) `GitLab` shows you the results of the build.


### Installation
#### Swift Package Manager
- File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency
- Add `URL`
- Select "Up to Next Major" with "VERSION"
#### `SupportingFiles` secrets #####
* copy `Development.xcconfig` and `Production.xcconfig` to `OSCAEssentials/OSCAEssentials/SupportingFiles`, these files have to be ignored by git
